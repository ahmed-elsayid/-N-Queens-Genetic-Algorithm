# N-Queens Genetic Algorithm

Solve the N-Queens problem with a genetic algorithm. This Python project generates and evolves populations of N-Queens configurations, aiming to find an optimal solution. Customize parameters like population size and mutation rate to observe the algorithm's evolution over generations.
